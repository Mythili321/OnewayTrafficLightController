#  1-Way Traffic Light Controller (SystemVerilog)

This is **my first SystemVerilog project** that implements a 1-way traffic light controller using a finite state machine (FSM). The controller cycles through standard traffic light states:

- **RED**
- **GREEN**
- **YELLOW**

Each light stays ON for exactly **5 clock cycles** before transitioning to the next state.
